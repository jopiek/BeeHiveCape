To enable the uarts 1,2,4 and/or 5 on the BeagleBone Black, rev A, B and C:
Rev A/B: Open the file /media/BEAGLEBONE/uEnv.txt in an editor (vim/nano)
Rev C: Open the file /boot/uboot/uEnv.txt in an editor (vim/nano)
Add the key "capemgr.enable_partno="
Add the ports you want to enable, comma separated (BB-UART2, BB-UART5)
Reboot (command: reboot)

An example line looks like this:
root@beaglebone:/dev# cat /media/BEAGLEBONE/uEnv.txt
optargs=quiet drm.debug=7 capemgr.enable_partno=BB-UART2, BB-UART5

After reboot, the device is present in the device list:
root@beaglebone:/dev# ls -l /dev/ttyO*
crw--w---- 1 root tty     248, 0 Jan  1 01:21 /dev/ttyO0
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 248, 2 Jan  1 01:40 /dev/ttyO2
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 248, 5 Jan  1 01:40 /dev/ttyO5

note: it is tty Oh 2/5, not tty zero 2/5

echo BB-UART2 > /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.xxx/slots
xxx was 8 in my case (check /sys/devices/ (cd /sys/devices [enter] ls [enter]))


3. Working with the BeeHive Cape

3a How to see if you get a connection

There are more than one solutions for this.
The easiest way is getting two XBee modules (both from the same series, so S1 or S2).

You have the option to also get an XBee Explorer (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8687 or something like that) (recommended).
If you don't have an XBee Explorer (or compatible) you can also plug the two XBee modules directly to the two XBee sockets on the BeeHive Cape.

3b XBee Explorer 
Connect the XBee Explorer to you computer
Open a terminal (I use CoolTerm) but you could even use XCTU(ng)
Make sure you are connected to your local XBee module

Connect the XBee module to the first XBee module socket (UART 2) 
In the terminal of the BeagleBone Black:
minicom -b 9600 -D /dev/ttyO2

Type something in the terminal and see the result on your computer and vice-versa.

3c If you don't have an XBee Explorer:
- get an XBee Explorer
- while you wait for the delivery guy:
open a second terminal and SSH to you beaglebone
- plug the second XBee into your other BeeHive Cape socket (UART 5) 

minicom -b 9600 -D /dev/ttyO5

Type something in the first terminal (O2) and see it in the other (O5) and vice versa.

4 BoneScript with the BeeHive Shield

The following BoneScript source will open a connection on UART2. When you send characters from the terminal on your computer or other device it will show them in the console and send them back as an echo.

var b = require('bonescript');
var port = '/dev/ttyO2'; // desired UART, O2 or O5 for the BeeHive
var options = {
    baudrate: 9600 // baudrate
};

b.serialOpen(port, options, onSerial);

function onSerial(x) {
    if (x.err) {
        console.log('***ERROR*** ' + JSON.stringify(x)); // whoops... something wrong!?!
    }
    if (x.event == 'open') {
       console.log('***OPENED***');  // now we are talking
    }
    if (x.event == 'data') {
        console.log(String(x.data)); // show received characters in console
        b.serialWrite(port, x.data); // echo back received characters
    }
}
